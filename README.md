## 🎶 AI-Powered Generative Synth

**PolliSonic Generator** generates evolving MIDI-based melodies from text prompts using AI. It seamlessly integrates with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) to create unique musical sequences and provides dynamic controls for sound design and effects.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [interzone.art.br/pollisonic_generator](https://interzone.art.br/pollisonic_generator/)

## ✨ Features
- **AI-Generated Sequences** – Uses [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/) to convert text prompts into MIDI patterns.
- **Dynamic Sound Control** – Real-time manipulation of volume, filter, distortion, envelope, and more.
- **Global Effects** – Delay and reverb applied to the master output.
- **Looping & Randomization** – Infinite generative loops with randomized parameters for variation.
- **Independent Channel Control** – Start, stop, and tweak each synth separately.
- **Real-Time Visualization** – Frequency spectrum display for each synth.
- **Responsive UI** – Scrollable container ensures usability across screen sizes.
