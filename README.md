## 🎶 AI-Powered Generative Modular Synth

**midijourney_generative_synth** is an AI-driven generative modular synthesizer that transforms text prompts into evolving MIDI compositions. It integrates a modular synth engine with customizable sound design and AI-generated sequences, providing an ever-changing sonic experience.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [www.interzone.art.br/midijourney_gen_synth](https://interzone.art.br/midijourney_gen_synth/)

## ✨ Features
- **AI-Generated Sequences** – Uses [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/) to convert text prompts into MIDI patterns.
- **Modular Synth Architecture** – Fully customizable synth modules (Beat, Bass, Lead, Pad, Glitch).
- **Dynamic Sound Control** – Real-time manipulation of volume, filter, distortion, envelope, and more.
- **Global Effects** – Delay and reverb applied to the master output.
- **Looping & Randomization** – Infinite generative loops with randomized parameters for variation.
- **Independent Channel Control** – Start, stop, and tweak each module separately.
- **Real-Time Visualization** – Frequency spectrum display for each module.
- **Responsive UI** – Scrollable module container ensures usability across screen sizes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/rafabez/midijourney_generative_synth.git
 cd midijourney_generative_synth
```

### 2️⃣ Open Locally
Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No server setup is required.

### 3️⃣ Usage
1. Enter a **text prompt** for AI-generated MIDI sequences.
2. Click **Generate** to create a looping pattern.
3. Adjust the **synth parameters** for unique sound design.
4. Control **global effects** (delay & reverb) for added depth.
5. Use **Stop** to halt individual channels.

## 🎛️ Modular Synth Structure
- **Beat** – AI-generated percussive rhythms.
- **Bass** – Fat, deep low-end synthesis.
- **Lead** – High-tech psychedelic lead synth.
- **Pad** – Smooth, evolving atmospheric layers.
- **Glitch** – Experimental metallic textures.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) – Web Audio API-based synthesizer.
- [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/) – AI-based MIDI pattern generation.
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for modular UI.
